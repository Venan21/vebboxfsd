            India's 5-match Test series against England gave the team management the opportunity to try some of the next-generation stars. The likes of Sarfaraz Khan, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar, Akash Deep, and Dhruv Jurel, all made their debuts in the series, and produced performances worthy of cementing their places in the squad, to say the least. But, it has now been learned that some of these debuts didn't come from the head coach Rahul Dravid, or skipper Rohit Sharma. Instead, it was the chief selector Ajit Agarkar who pushed the team management into selecting some of these players.

            As per a report, Agarkar was the one who suggested Dhruv Jurel's name for the wicket-keeper's spot to coach Dravid and captain Rohit. The Indian team tried KS Bharat behind the stumps for the first couple of matches but the wicket-keeper batter didn't manage to impress much. But, Dhruv, as soon as he came into the team, left an impressive impression both as a keeper and a batter.
