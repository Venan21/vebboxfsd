        hi  With just a week to go for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 campaign to begin, the Royal Challengers Bangalore seem to be heading towards a name change. In a video shared by the franchise on social media, the management seems to be edging closer to getting rid of the word ‘Bangalore' from the name of the franchise. In all likeliness, the ‘Bangalore' will be replaced by ‘Bengaluru' in the name of the franchise, in sync with the city's new name.

        Since the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League in 2008, Royal Challengers Bangalore has remained the franchise's name despite the city's title changing from Bangalore to Bengaluru. It was in 2014 that the transformation from Bangalore to Bengaluru happened. But, that didn't prompt a change for RCB. However, ahead of the IPL 2024 season, RCB finally seem to be in the process of making the change.
        
        In its 16 years of participation in the IPL, the Royal Challengers have never gone on to win the league title. The name change could chang the fortunes of the franchise a little but there remains no guarantee. Another IPL side, Punjab Kings, had changed its name (earlier known as Kings XI Punjab) but that didn't lead to any change in their fate. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Even the Delhi Capitals, earlier known as the Delhi Daredevils, changed their name but they too haven't been able to win an IPL title yet.
